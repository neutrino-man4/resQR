# resQR: Quantile Regression for the VAE-QR Analysis

### Author: Aritra Bal (KIT)

Re-write of the Quantile Regression repository used in the CMS Analysis [CMS-EXO-22-026](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6633/add762), part of the larger VAE-QR method. This features a Variational Autoencoder optimised to reconstruct non-anomalous data, with the reconstruction quality serving as an anomaly metric, and subsequently a DNN-based quantile regression to decorrelate the anomaly score from the variable of interest. 

More details to follow.
